The iRRAM-backend of version of kirk depends on my master-branch of iRRAM,
	<https://github.com/fbrausse/iRRAM>

There is a preliminary Haskell binding is implemented using the hmpfr library,
	<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmpfr>
which uses the function 'peekP' to construct Data.Number.MPFR objects from raw
data. This function has not been exposed by hmpfr before v0.4.3. It is enabled
by the Makefile automatically, if 'ghc-pkg' finds hmpfr-0.4.3.

Another Haskell MPFR backend, rounded-0.1.0.1,
	<https://github.com/michalkonecny/rounded/tree/michal>
is selected by the Makefile, if 'ghc-pkg' finds rounded-0.1.0.1. This option
takes precedence if both are available.
