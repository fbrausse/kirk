The iRRAM-backend of version of kirk depends on my master-branch of iRRAM,
	<https://github.com/fbrausse/iRRAM>
which only compiles using the 5.x series of g++ or any clang++. Sorry for the
inconvenience, this will change in the near future.


The preliminary Haskell binding is implemented using the hmpfr library,
	<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmpfr>
and uses the function 'peekP' to construct Data.Number.MPFR objects from raw
data. This function has not been exposed by hmpfr before v0.4.3.
